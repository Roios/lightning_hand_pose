# Hand Pose estimation using the PyTorch Lightning framework

## Objective

The objective of this project is to have a complete machine learning pipeline (training, validation, testing) based on the PyTorch Lightning framework.

## Motivation

[PyTorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/) is presented to us as a PyTorch framework that allow us to right machine learning pipelines in a faster, cleaner and less complicated way without any cost in performance.

As a daily user of PyTorch, I wanted to experiment this framework to better understand its pros and cons.
The best way to understand it is to get the hands dirty so I took a simple project based on PyTorch and I will "convert" it to PyTorch Ligthning.

## Use case

Recently I found the project [_2D Hand Pose Estimation from RGB Image_](https://github.com/OlgaChernytska/2D-Hand-Pose-Estimation-RGB) by Olga Chernytska.

She explains the idea of the project in the following tutorials:
- [Gentle introduction to 2D Hand Pose Estimation: Approach Explained](https://notrocketscience.blog/gentle-introduction-to-2d-hand-pose-estimation-approach-explained/)
- [Gentle introduction to 2D Hand Pose Estimation: Let's Code It!](https://notrocketscience.blog/gentle-introduction-to-2d-hand-pose-estimation-lets-code-it/)

The tutorials are written in a very detailed and clear way that I will not reproduce them here.

For this project, open-source [FreiHAND](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/datasets/FreihandDataset.en.html) dataset is used.
The dataset is not part of this repository. It should be downloaded and moved to the root of the repo.

## Closure

I was able to train and run a model using the Pytorch Lightning framework. This repo is closed.
